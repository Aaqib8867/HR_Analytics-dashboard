I'm excited to share a dashboard I created in Power BI that dives deep into one of the most critical HR challenges today â€” Employee Attrition.

This interactive visualization uncovers:
ðŸ”¹ Overall attrition rate (16.1%)
ðŸ”¹ Highest attrition among age group 26-35
ðŸ”¹ Education background & salary slabs contributing most to attrition
ðŸ”¹ Job roles with the highest turnover
ðŸ”¹ Gender-wise attrition insights
ðŸ”¹ Years of service vs. attrition trends

ðŸ’¡ Key Insight: A majority of the attrition occurs in early years of service and in roles like Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive, especially in the lower salary brackets.

This dashboard aims to help HR teams and decision-makers identify red flags early and build strategies for employee engagement, retention, and workforce planning.
